Welcome to the Diabetes Predictor project! This machine learning project is designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health-related features.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable model for diabetes prediction, leveraging the power of decision tree classification. We've optimized the model using hyperparameter tuning to enhance its performance.

## Key Features

- **Diabetes Prediction:** Utilizing a Decision Tree Classifier for accurate diabetes prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Fine-tuned model parameters for improved accuracy.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python.
